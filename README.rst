Veganisme.dk: Veganske produkter
==========

Idea:
-----
The idea of this project is to make a site that indexes products in relation to if they're vegan or not. 
What is veganism you ask? This: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism

In order to do this there's a database at the heart of the site that contains a list of products (like Mamba), brands (like Storck), manufacturers (citation_needed) and ingredients. 

The site relies heavily on user submitted data, so there's a form submission page for handling changes as well as adding new products. The idea is that before these changes are in fact adopted, they will be moderator approved, so somehow there should be some temporary staging area for new, unvalidated items to reside, as well as a place for unvalidated item changes to reside, perhaps even multiple enteties of these, requiring to be merged.

Sites:
------
1. **All pages:** A banner or title of sorts, a navigation bar and a search field, with a form that changes what you're searching on.

2. **Index:** Containing a description of the site more or less.

3. **Site overview:** A list of everything, usable until the database gets sufficiently big, then it'll have to be categorised into smaller chunks.

4. **Product page:** A page listing the individual products one at a time.

5. **Brand page:** A page listing the individual brands one at a time.

6. **Manufacturer page:** A page listing the individual manufacturers one at a time.

7. **Ingredient page:** A page listing the individual ingredients one at a time.

8. **Add item page:** A form to add a new product.

9. **Edit item page:** A form to edit an existing product.

10. **About page:** A page about the site.

Todo:
-----

Can be reordered according to importance.

1. Make the add item form work, with the staging area for unapproved new items.
2. Make the edit item form work, with the staging area for edits.
3. Design the pages. My (xlys) idea is to use (and in the process learn) bootstrap.

	* Product
	* Brand
	* Manufacturer
	* Ingredient
	* Store

4. Improve search. Make it possible to search for products alone, or brands, or organic, and combine these criteria.
5. Make a user system, which includes the capacity to post comments as well as track the changes you've contributed (at least).
6. Make the comments system.
7. Make images work.
8. Make the ingredients page be capable of showing only the alias field(s) if they're filled out. (The same ingredient can have several names.)
